= Confronting Antisemitism

Antisemitism has long been a latent feature of German society, but since the beginning of the economic depression, it has grown to a horrifying extent. The Nazis are the worst of it, but all the right-wing parties are deeply antisemitic. Regarding the Center Party specifically, our right-wing members love to deploy their racist rhetoric against many Jewish politicians, magnifying criticism of any minor transgression.

- @racist: The Jews are the ones responsible for this economic crisis. Attack them vehemently in our campaign speeches.
- @if: Antisemitism is a crisis. Direct the full force of the Center Party against antisemitism.
- @all: All Germans will suffer from fascism, not just the Jews. We do not need a separate policy for them.

Judeobolshevism has permeated every corner of our society. We must cooperate with the right wing parties to keep the socialists out of power.

We do not need any special treatment for minorities.
