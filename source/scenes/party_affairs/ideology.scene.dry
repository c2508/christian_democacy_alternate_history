= Questions of Ideology

The SPD is torn between many different ideological currents. What should be our primary ideological guidance for now?

[? if ideology != 0 : We have previously chosen a [+ ideology +] ideology. Changing it will likely have drawbacks. ?]

- @left_labor: Republicanism and cooperation with the SPD are our primary goals.
- @centrist: We should continue to advance the rights of Catholics through the democratic framework.
- @right_labor: With a focus on protecting workers' welfare, we should oppose socialism and laissez-faire capitalism.
- @right: By working with reactionary institutions, we should restore the monarchy under the Kaiser.
- @easy_discard

The right labor wing of the party supports continued particpation in government in order to provide benefits to the workers, but detest socialism and would prefer to work with the conservative right.

Represented by bourgeouisie aristocrats and agarian interests, the right wing of the party seeks to restore the monarchy under the Kaiser.
