= Center Party Conference

# reference: Evans, Ellen L. “Adam Stegerwald and the Role of the Christian Trade Unions in the Weimar Republic.” The Catholic Historical Review 59, no. 4 (1974): 602–26.

Wilhelm Marx, former Center Party chancellor and presidential candidate, has chosen to resign from leadership of the Center Party. Now, the party holds a conference to replace him.

The party has splintered in two over the vote to decide his sucessor. The current frontrunner is Christian labor union chairman Adam Stegerwald. On the other hand, there is Joseph Joos, who has been more supportive of cooperation with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> than most of the party. However, if the vote remains deadlocked, a compromise candidate will be selected instead.

- @stegerwald: The Center Party elects Adam Stegerwald as the party chair. 
- @joos: The Center Party to select Joseph Joos as the party chair.
- @kaas: The Center Party selects Ludwig Kaas as the party chair.

With our strong grassroots connections with the SPD, they have been able to influence the Center delegates to support Joseph Joos as the new Center chairman. He has long been a friend of the SPD, and will be more inclined to collaborate with the SPD compared to Stegerwald. He also increases the appeal of the Center Party to the working class.

Ludwig Kaas has been selected as the chairman of the [? if z_party_name != "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span>?][? if z_party_name == "CVP": <span style="color: #000000;">**CVP**</span>?] as a compromise candidate between Stegerwald and Joos.

Despite this, Kaas is committed to the current constitutional order and the republic. He maintains a close friendship with Eugenio Pacelli, the Papal Nuncio to Germany, which may prove useful during concordat negotiations.
